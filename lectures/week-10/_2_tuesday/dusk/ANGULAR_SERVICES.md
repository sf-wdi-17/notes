#Angular Services

> **Objective**: to be able to write AngularJS services to mock data, connect to external or internal APIs, and syncronize data across controllers.

## What is an AngularJS Service? . . . a Factory!

#### Separation of Concerns & Segregation of Duties

Angular is really good at helping you safely and rationally **separate concerns** and **segregate duties**. In addition to **Controllers** and **Templates** (as we saw in Rails and Express) AngularJS has **Directives** for complex manipulation of the DOM, **Filters** for manipulating sets of data, and **Services** for getting, storing, and syncronizing data across controllers and views.

#### Syncronizing Data Across Controllers

Controllers in Angular (and other apps!) are for single use only and they don't communicate with each other. E.g. when you change routes you will lose the data you've loaded up into your present controller, or if you have two controllers running to mananage two suptemplates, they don't be able to share data. Unless. . . you use a service to get, store, and sycronize data!

You could also have 2 or more controllers running at once in one view and you'll want to syncronize data across them. But **controllers can't talk to each other** or be injected into each other. But never fear, Angular gives us powerful methods called $broadcast, $emit, and $on to have controllers and services communicate to each other.

> **Services** are for getting, storing, and syncronizing data across your apps controllers and views.

> $emit dispatches an event upwards ... $broadcast dispatches an event downwards.

Services can be used to. . .

*  Interact with an external APIs
*  Share objects/data across views and controllers
*  Interact with a device API (localstorage, push notifications, etc)
*  Abstract repeated methods (to dry up code)

There are native Angular services, angular-plugin services, and your own custom services.

#####Some Native Angular Services
* $http - for ajax calls
* $timeout - for setting timeouts
* $location - for manipulating urls and paths
* $window - for accessing attributes of the browser window

#####Some Common Angular Plugin Services
* $resource (ngResource)
* $state (ui-router)
* $filter

#####Examples of Custom Services
* Post (to interact with your API '/posts/:id' url)
* AuthService (to abstract some repeated methods concering authentication)
* MapService (manage methods related to geolocation objects)
* ...


## Challenge 1: Setup Mock API Data Service - 20 min

1. Clone this [angular-basic](https://github.com/ajbraus/angular-basic) temtplate
2. Add this service (code below) to your app.js
3. Inject the Movie service into your controller
4. Use ng-repeat to display a list or table of movies in a view

```JS
/*
 * Movie Service
 */
 
.factory('Movie', function() {

  // Some fake testing data
  var movies = [{
    id: 0,
    title: 'Pirates of the Carribean',
    poster_url: 'http://images.vcpost.com/data/images/full/48799/pirates-of-the-carribean-dead-men-tell-no-tales.jpg'
  }, {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Pirates of the Carribean',
    poster_url: 'http://images.vcpost.com/data/images/full/48799/pirates-of-the-carribean-dead-men-tell-no-tales.jpg'
  },{
    id: 2,
    title: 'Pirates of the Carribean',
    poster_url: 'http://images.vcpost.com/data/images/full/48799/pirates-of-the-carribean-dead-men-tell-no-tales.jpg'
  }, {
    id: 3,
    title: 'Pirates of the Carribean',
    poster_url: 'http://images.vcpost.com/data/images/full/48799/pirates-of-the-carribean-dead-men-tell-no-tales.jpg'
  }, {
    id: 4,
    title: 'Pirates of the Carribean',
    poster_url: 'http://images.vcpost.com/data/images/full/48799/pirates-of-the-carribean-dead-men-tell-no-tales.jpg'
  }];

  return {
    all: function() {
      return movies;
    },
    remove: function(chat) {
      movies.splice(movies.indexOf(movie), 1);
    },
    get: function(movieId) {
      for (var i = 0; i < movies.length; i++) {
        if (movies[i].id === parseInt(movieId)) {
          return movies[i];
        }
      }
      return null;
    }
  };
});

```

## Challenge 2: Make an $http to call an API - 20 min

1. Put the following HTML into your view and controller code into your MoviesCtrl. Can you search in your view?
2. Comment out the mock data from the Movie service.
3. Have the Movie service return the searchMovies method. 
4. Display the OMDBapi data in your view.
5. Use ng-repeat to make a list.
6. **Extra Credit**: Can you display an error message if it finds no movies with an ```alert()```? Can you do the same with ```ng-show```?

```HTML

<form ng-submit="searchMovies()">
  <input ng-model='search' class="form-control" />
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Search</button>
</form>

<div ng-repeat="movie in movies">
  {{movie.Title}}
</div>

```

```JS

/*
 *  MOVIECtrl.js
 */

...

$scope.searchMovies = function() {
  $http.get('http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=' + $scope.search)
    .success(function(data) {
      console.log("Succeeded : ) ");
      console.log(data);
      // $scope.movies = data.Search
    }).failure(function(data) {
      console.log("Failed : ( ");
      $scope.movies = [];
    })
}
...

```

## Challenge 3. Make a new $broadcast, $on function

1. Make a new branch of angular-basic
2. Look at how the current $broadcast, $on listeners are working.
3. Change the function to add 2 points every time you click the button.
4. Make a div appear when the current_user.points == 10.
5. Make the input field change the website's name.

## Other Examples of Services

#### An Auth Service

You can also abstract random methods and objects into your services to dry up your code. 

```JS
.factory('AuthService', function ($rootScope, User) {
    return {
      checkLogin: function() {
        // Check if logged in and fire events
        if(this.isLoggedIn()) {
          $rootScope.$broadcast('app.loggedIn'); 
        } else {
          $rootScope.$broadcast('app.loggedOut'); 
        }
      },
      isLoggedIn: function() {
        // Check auth token here from localStorage
        if (localStorage.getItem("auth_token") === null || localStorage.getItem("auth_token") === "undefined") {
          return false
        } else {
          return true
        };
      },
      logout: function(email, pass) {
       // Same thing, log out user
       $rootScope.$broadcast('app.loggedOut');
      }
    }
  })
```

#### How to Consume Your Own RESTful API: $resource (ngResource)

Most APIs and all that you build should be RESTful and respond to the basic

| URL           | HTTP     | CONTROLLER        |
| ------------- |:--------:| -----------------:|
| /articles     | GET      | articles#index    |
| /articles     | POST     | articles#create   |
| /articles/:id | GET      | articles#show     |
| /articles/:id | PUT      | articles#update   |
| /articles/:id | DELETE   | articles#destroy  |

And for this a nice bunch of Angular developers made **ngResource** which gives you the custom service **$resource** that exposes 5 routes.

```JS
{ 'get':    {method:'GET'},
  'save':   {method:'POST'},
  'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},
  'remove': {method:'DELETE'},
  'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };
```
$resource can very quickly dry up lots of code and it forces you to be **very RESTful** in your API design.

```JS
// services.js

  .factory('Post', function ($resource) {
    return $resource('http://yourdomain.com/posts/:id', { id: '@id' })
  })
```

So a long ```$http.get``` call can be reduced to one line:

```JS
// controller.js

$scope.post = Post.get($scope.postId)
```

##Good to Know

### Sample Folder Structure
Sample Angular folder structure

```
|app
  |images  
  |js
    |controllers
      |--mainCtrl.js
      |--chatCtrl.js
      |--...
    |vendor
      |--angular.js
      |--angular-resource.js
      |--...
    |--app.js
    |--services.js
    |--...(directives.js, filters.js, interceptors.js, etc)
  |styles
  |templates
    |movies
    |site
  |--index.html
```

### Good to Know: Services vs. Factory (vs. Provider)

These are just two flavors of services. Use service() when you want to return a function with methods. Use factory() when you want to return an object or array of objects.

```JS
app.service('myService', function() {
  // service is just a constructor function that will be called with 'new'

  this.sayHello = function(name) {
     return "Hi " + name + "!";
  }
});

app.factory('myFactory', function() {
  // factory returns an object you can run some code before

  return {
    sayHello : function(name) {
      return "Hi " + name + "!";
    }
  }
});
```

>**Note**: Services and Factories are built on Providers. Providers are instantiated before configuration meaning they can't receive other injected services and you use providers if you want to instantiate something before the app runs

### Q&A
How would you make your data persistent? 

* Parse
* Firebase
* localStorage
* Two way API
* Your own server

#Lab Challenge

####Hack Onward!
1. Find a teammate or work on your own.
2. Decide how you want to enhance your search API and improve your OMDBAPI app. You could:
* Display a search input and below it search results.
* Display a filter input and below it your list of movies.
* Make a "Want to See" button for each movie.
* Track "Want to See" movies in a separate list
* Use a 'List' service to have methods that add and remove movies to a list.

####Extra Credit
* Use "ng-repeat='movie in movies | filter'" to filter your list of movies
* Add another field to your search of omdbapi.com
* Create a list of "favorited movies" - controller code getting fat? Need another service!
