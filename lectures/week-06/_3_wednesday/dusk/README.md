# Introduction To RSpec
Lecture on test driven development with RSpec and how to test Ruby code.

## Objective
Students will be able to...

- Apply their knowledge of test driven development to Ruby programs
- Read and understand RSpec tests
- Write their own RSpec tests
- Distinguish between and use keywords such as
	- `let` and `let!`
	- `describe`
	- `it`
	- `expect`
	- `context`
	- `before`
	- `change`

## Link
As we have seen with test driven development for JavaScript using Mocha and Chai, it is an extremely important development practice. We will explore how to apply test driven development for Ruby application using a testing framework called RSpec (Ruby specification).

## Educate and Engage
Head on over to this [repository](https://github.com/sf-wdi-17/rspec-intro).

## Reflect
[rspec.info](http://rspec.info/) is your go-to reference point for anything RSpec. For more detailed information and API reference, check out [Relish](http://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs).

## Now and Then
We will use RSpec again for test driven development in Ruby on Rails. RSpec is a very established testing framework, used for most Ruby programs, so it is likely that you will use it throughout your career as Ruby programmer.
