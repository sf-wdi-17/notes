# Schedule Week 11

## The Schedule

I've adjusted the schedule a bit to reflect how we'll be handling this week. In each time slot between Wednesday and Friday, we'll be breaking the class up into two sections. We'll be using the subdivider to create 2 classrooms in our usual space, and you'll be able to attend either **Room 1** or **Room 2** based on what you are most interested in learning.  In general, the week will be heavy on exercises with us supporting your efforts. 

| Time    | Section | Tuesday               | Wednesday                 | Thursday              | Friday         |  
| ------- | ------- | -------               | ------------              | --------              | -----          |

## The Deets

This week is a bit of a mish-mash of topics based **the choices all of you made in class on Friday**. Topics include:

  * Angular Review, plus
      - Rails Backend
      - Node Backend
  * NoSQL Stores
      - Redis
      - MongoDB
  * Mobile Dev with Ionic
  * Web Dev with Python
  * Review Sessions on:
      - Express
      - Front End JS

## Some Other Stuff

If you can, please decide, in advance, which sessions you're interested in attending. It will be better for everyone if people are not jumping back and forth between sessions. I understand the desire to try to get a little bit 'o everything, but you'll probably be better off if you focus on a few of these topics.

Finally, Project 3, your final tour de force is coming up. Start thinking about what you want to work on and know that there **are no specs** for the third project. In other words, your project, your choice. We are happy to help guide you and help you with architecture, idea, whatever, but we won't be "approving" these projects as we have in the past. Use whatever technologies you like, and whatever structure you like.
